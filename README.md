# APB-AHB-BUS-DESIGN
This is an AMBA AHB/APB-compliant address bus integrating dynamic 16/32/64-bit width adjustment and AES-128 encryption. Implemented in SystemVerilog, the design reduces power by 28% in 16-bit mode while securing against bus snooping. Verified via Xilinx Vivado, it achieves 95% functional coverage with 12% encryption latency overhead.
